# point_source_pollution
A model I made to measure the differences of different point source polution.

Presentation folder contains both the presentation for it and the paper written for it.

The Puff model contains all files neccessary to run the model. Run the notebooks named "chimney" and "car" to run the full model.

The Gaussian Plume model has a single R Markdown file that contains the calculations.
